# Lambda Functions or Anonymous Functions

In Python, anonymous function is a function that is defined without a name.

While normal functions are defined using the def keyword, in Python anonymous functions are defined using the lambda keyword.
Hence, anonymous functions are also called lambda functions.

Syntax of these functions are: `lambda arguments: expression`

### Examples:

* 1:  ``double = lambda x: x * 2
print(double(5)) # Ans 10``

* 2:  `(lambda x, y: x ** 2 + y ** 2)(2, 1)`
