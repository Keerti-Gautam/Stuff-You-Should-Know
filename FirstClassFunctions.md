# First Class Functions

A first-class function is not a particular kind of function.
All functions in Python are first-class functions.

To say that functions are first-class in a certain programming language means that they can be passed around and manipulated similarly to how you would pass around and manipulate other kinds of objects (like integers or strings).
You can assign a function to a variable, pass it as an argument to another function, etc.

The distinction is not that individual functions can be first class or not, but that entire languages may treat functions as first-class objects, or may not.

Python, JavaScript and C(pointers) support first class functions.

First Class Functions in a programming language are objects (using the term "objects" very freely here) which:

* Can be used as parameters
* Can be used as a return value
* Can be assigned to variables
* Can be stored in data structures such as hash tables, lists, etc

You can do with them everything you can do with a 'normal' variable.
