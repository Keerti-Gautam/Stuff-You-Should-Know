PPAs are acronyms for Personal Package Archives. 

PPAs are a way of distributing your software directly to ubuntu users and the updates of PPAs are automatically received to users as and when the author makes them.
These are generally used by people who want the latest updates while working on some software. 

I stumbled upon this word while searching for ways to install Brackets code editor for my usual web development work (Yeah, I am new to ubuntu really) and it said "steps to install Brackets via a PPA".

Anyway, so these PPAs can be easily made by anyone which is cool in itself except the fact there's actually no guarantee if it is secure or not just like any other unofficial software that you download in Windows. You can find all the PPAs on Launchpad, that's where they're published. 

Make sure you trust the PPA you're adding to your system because once installed, it gains root access to your system (Administrative access) so anyone who uploads the PPA has root access to your system. Knowing this fact is really important I think.
